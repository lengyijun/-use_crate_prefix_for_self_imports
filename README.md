```
cargo dylint --git https://github.com/lengyijun/use_crate_prefix_for_self_imports 
```

Because no response from https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/13662 , I have to turn to dylint.

### What it does

### Why is this bad?

### Known problems
Remove if none.

### Example
```rust
// example code where a warning is issued
```
Use instead:
```rust
// example code that does not raise a warning
```
